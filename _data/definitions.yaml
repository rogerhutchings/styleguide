            slug: actor
            text: "Use for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, eg Oscar for best actress. The Guardian's view is that actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, \"lady doctor\", \"male nurse\" and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: \"An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything.\"<br><br>\nThere is normally no need to differentiate between the sexes – and if there is, the words male and female are perfectly adequate: Lady Gaga won a Brit in 2010 for best international female artist, not artiste, chanteuse, or songstress.<br><br>\nAs always, use common sense: a piece about the late film director Carlo Ponti was edited to say that in his early career he was \"already a man with a good eye for pretty actors ... \" As the readers' editor pointed out in the subsequent clarification: \"This was one of those occasions when the word 'actresses' might have been used\""

            text: "Though Arabic has only three vowels – a, i and u – it has several consonants that have no equivalent in the Roman alphabet. For instance, there are two kinds of s, d and t. There are also two glottal sounds. This means there are dozens of ways of writing the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's name in English, and a reasonable argument can be made for adopting almost any of them. With no standard approach to transliteration agreed by the western media, we must try to balance consistency, comprehensibility and familiarity – which often puts a strain on all three.\n<br><br>Typically, Arabs have at least three names. In some cases the first or second name may be the one that is most used, and this does not imply familiarity (Arabs often address foreigners politely as \"Mr John\" or \"Dr David\"). Often Arabs also have familiar names that have no connection with the names on their identity cards: a man might become known after the birth of his first son as \"Abu Ahmad\", and a woman as \"Umm Ahmad\", the father or mother of Ahmad (eg the Palestinian leader Ahmed Qureia is commonly known as Abu Ala).\n<br><br>Where a particular spelling has become widely accepted through usage we should retain it. Where an individual with links to the west has clearly adopted a particular spelling of his or her own name, we should respect that. For breaking news and stories using names for which we have no established style, we take the lead given by Reuters wire copy.\n<br><br>Note also that names in some parts of the Arab world have become gallicised, while others have become anglicised, eg the leading Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine uses a French spelling instead of the English transliteration, Shaheen."

Sometimes it appears as as- or ash- or ad- or ul-: these should be ignored and can be safely rewritten as al-. But some Arabs, including Syrians and Egyptians, prefer to use el- in place of al-. Exceptions: by convention, Allah (al-Lah, literally \"the God\") is written as one word and capitalised; and in Saudi royal names, Al Saud is correct (in this case, \"al\" is actually \"aal\" and does not mean \"the\").\n\n<br><br><strong>abdul, abu and bin</strong> These are not self-contained names, but are connected to the name that follows: \nabdul means \"slave of … \" and so cannot correctly be used on its own. There are standard combinations, \"slave of the merciful one\", \"slave of the generous one\", etc, which all indicate that the person is a servant of God. In transliteration, \"abd\" (slave) is lowercase, eg Ahmad abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf, except when used at the start of a name.\nabu (father of) and bin (son of) are similar. When they appear in the middle of a name they should be lower case and are used in combination with the following part of the name: Faisal abu Ahmad al-Saqqaf, Faisal bin Ahmad al-Saqqaf.\nDespite the above, some people are actually known as \"Abdul\". This is more common among non-Arab Muslims. And some Arabs run \"abd\" or \"abu\" into the following word, eg the writer Abdelrahman Munif."

A brief explanation: long odds (eg 100-1 against, normally expressed as 100-1) mean something unlikely; shorter odds (eg 10-1) still mean it's unlikely, but less unlikely; odds on (eg 2-1 on, sometimes expressed as 1-2) means it is likely, so if you were betting £2 you would win only £1 plus the stake. \n<br><br>Take care using the phrase \"odds on\": if Labour is quoted by bookmakers at 3-1 to win a byelection, and the odds are cut to 2-1, it is wrong to say \"the odds on Labour to win were cut last night\" – in fact, the odds against Labour to win have been cut (the shorter the price, the more likely something is expected to happen). \n<br><br>It gets more complicated when something is genuinely odds-on, ie bookmakers quote a price of \"2-1 on\": in this case, if the Labour candidate is quoted at 2-1 on and becomes an even hotter favourite, at 3-1 on, the odds have shortened; if Labour loses popularity, and 2-1 on becomes, say, 7-4 on or evens, the odds have lengthened"
