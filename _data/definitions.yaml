            text: "Do not use full points in abbreviations, or spaces between initials, including those in proper names: IMF, mph, eg, 4am, M&amp;S, No 10, AN Wilson, WH Smith, etc.\nUse all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as awol, laser and, more recently, asbo, pin number and sim card. Note that pdf and plc are lowercase.\nIf an abbreviation or acronym is to be used more than once in a piece, put it in brackets at first mention: so Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), seasonal affective disorder (Sad); alternatively, use the abbreviation with a brief description, eg the conservation charity the RSPB. Remember that our international online readership will not necessarily be aware of even well-known UK abbreviations. If an organisation is mentioned only once, it is not necessary to give its abbreviation or acronym.\nCap up single letters in such expressions as C-list, F-word, &quot;the word assassin contains four Ss&quot;, etc\nSee contractions"

            text: "Use for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, eg Oscar for best actress. The Guardian&#39;s view is that actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, &quot;lady doctor&quot;, &quot;male nurse&quot; and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: &quot;An actress can only play a woman. I&#39;m an actor – I can play anything.&quot;\nThere is normally no need to differentiate between the sexes – and if there is, the words male and female are perfectly adequate: Lady Gaga won a Brit in 2010 for best international female artist, not artiste, chanteuse, or songstress.\nAs always, use common sense: a piece about the late film director Carlo Ponti was edited to say that in his early career he was &quot;already a man with a good eye for pretty actors ... &quot; As the readers&#39; editor pointed out in the subsequent clarification: &quot;This was one of those occasions when the word &#39;actresses&#39; might have been used&quot;"

At an international level, the 22 members of the Arab League can safely be described as Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

            text: "Though Arabic has only three vowels – a, i and u – it has several consonants that have no equivalent in the Roman alphabet. For instance, there are two kinds of s, d and t. There are also two glottal sounds. This means there are dozens of ways of writing the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi&#39;s name in English, and a reasonable argument can be made for adopting almost any of them. With no standard approach to transliteration agreed by the western media, we must try to balance consistency, comprehensibility and familiarity – which often puts a strain on all three.\nTypically, Arabs have at least three names. In some cases the first or second name may be the one that is most used, and this does not imply familiarity (Arabs often address foreigners politely as &quot;Mr John&quot; or &quot;Dr David&quot;). Often Arabs also have familiar names that have no connection with the names on their identity cards: a man might become known after the birth of his first son as &quot;Abu Ahmad&quot;, and a woman as &quot;Umm Ahmad&quot;, the father or mother of Ahmad (eg the Palestinian leader Ahmed Qureia is commonly known as Abu Ala).\nWhere a particular spelling has become widely accepted through usage we should retain it. Where an individual with links to the west has clearly adopted a particular spelling of his or her own name, we should respect that. For breaking news and stories using names for which we have no established style, we take the lead given by Reuters wire copy.\nNote also that names in some parts of the Arab world have become gallicised, while others have become anglicised, eg the leading Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine uses a French spelling instead of the English transliteration, Shaheen."

Sometimes it appears as as- or ash- or ad- or ul-: these should be ignored and can be safely rewritten as al-. But some Arabs, including Syrians and Egyptians, prefer to use el- in place of al-. Exceptions: by convention, Allah (al-Lah, literally &quot;the God&quot;) is written as one word and capitalised; and in Saudi royal names, Al Saud is correct (in this case, &quot;al&quot; is actually &quot;aal&quot; and does not mean &quot;the&quot;).\n\nabdul, abu and bin These are not self-contained names, but are connected to the name that follows: \nabdul means &quot;slave of … &quot; and so cannot correctly be used on its own. There are standard combinations, &quot;slave of the merciful one&quot;, &quot;slave of the generous one&quot;, etc, which all indicate that the person is a servant of God. In transliteration, &quot;abd&quot; (slave) is lowercase, eg Ahmad abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf, except when used at the start of a name.\nabu (father of) and bin (son of) are similar. When they appear in the middle of a name they should be lower case and are used in combination with the following part of the name: Faisal abu Ahmad al-Saqqaf, Faisal bin Ahmad al-Saqqaf.\nDespite the above, some people are actually known as &quot;Abdul&quot;. This is more common among non-Arab Muslims. And some Arabs run &quot;abd&quot; or &quot;abu&quot; into the following word, eg the writer Abdelrahman Munif."

A brief explanation: long odds (eg 100-1 against, normally expressed as 100-1) mean something unlikely; shorter odds (eg 10-1) still mean it&#39;s unlikely, but less unlikely; odds on (eg 2-1 on, sometimes expressed as 1-2) means it is likely, so if you were betting £2 you would win only £1 plus the stake. \nTake care using the phrase &quot;odds on&quot;: if Labour is quoted by bookmakers at 3-1 to win a byelection, and the odds are cut to 2-1, it is wrong to say &quot;the odds on Labour to win were cut last night&quot; – in fact, the odds against Labour to win have been cut (the shorter the price, the more likely something is expected to happen). \nIt gets more complicated when something is genuinely odds-on, ie bookmakers quote a price of &quot;2-1 on&quot;: in this case, if the Labour candidate is quoted at 2-1 on and becomes an even hotter favourite, at 3-1 on, the odds have shortened; if Labour loses popularity, and 2-1 on becomes, say, 7-4 on or evens, the odds have lengthened"

A barge is a broader (10-14ft wide) cargo-carrying boat - normally towed but sometimes self-powered. The version with accommodation is usually a Dutch barge. A cruiser is the white-hulled GRP (glass-reinforced plastic) style of boat, more commonly seen on rivers; smaller versions are cabin cruisers. \nThe difference between narrowboat and barge is important, particularly if you don&#39;t want to get stuck in a narrow lock somewhere outside Birmingham"

            text: "&quot;I am a poet: I distrust anything that starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop&quot; (Antjie Krog)\nTimes have changed since the days of medieval manuscripts with elaborate hand-illuminated capital letters, or Victorian documents in which not just proper names, but virtually all nouns, were given initial caps (a Tradition valiantly maintained to this day by Estate Agents).\nA look through newspaper archives would show greater use of capitals the further back you went. The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with capitals altogether.\nOur style reflects these developments. We aim for coherence and consistency, but not at the expense of clarity. As with any aspect of style, it is impossible to be wholly consistent – there are almost always exceptions, so if you are unsure check for an individual entry in this guide. But here are the main principles: \njobs all lc, eg prime minister, US secretary of state, chief rabbi, editor of the Guardian. \ntitles cap up titles, but not job description, eg President Barack Obama (but the US president, Barack Obama, and Obama on subsequent mention); the Duke of Westminster (the duke at second mention); Pope Francis but the pope."

We said in an obituary, for example, that Ronnie Barker was paid £1 9s (£1.45) a week for his first job in 1947 – a comparison of average earnings would convert that to around £113 today. Similarly, in converting the price of a &quot;four shilling dish of rice and vegetables&quot; in 1967 to 20p in today&#39;s money we forgot to allow for its relative value; taking into account changes in the retail price index it would now be worth £2.23.

If you need to use an adjective, it is female and not &quot;woman&quot; in such phrases as female bishops, female MPs, female president.\n\nDo not gratuitously describe a woman as a &quot;mother-of-three&quot;: family details and marital status are only relevant in stories about families or marriage. \n\nUse humankind or humanity rather than mankind, a word that, as one of our readers points out, &quot;alienates half the population from their own history&quot;.\n\nNever say &quot;his&quot; to cover men and women: use his or her, or a different construction; in sentences such as &quot;a teacher who beats his/her pupils is not fit to do the job&quot;, there is usually a way round the problem – in this case, &quot;teachers who beat their pupils ... &quot;\n\nMen (rarely women – funny, that) who occasionally question our policy and accuse us of &quot;political correctness&quot; may care to reflect on the fact that Fowler&#39;s used to list such &quot;established feminine titles&quot; as adventuress, authoress, editress, executrix, giantess, huntress, inspectress, Jewess, poetess, procuress, quakeress, songstress, tailoress, wardress; it also proposed new ones such as danceress and doctress (&quot;everyone knows the inconvenience of being uncertain whether a doctor is a man or a woman&quot;)"

He had a point. Generations of schoolchildren were taught grammar as an arbitrary set of dos and don&#39;ts laid down by people who knew, or thought they knew, best.\nNowadays, grammar might be more helpfully defined as the set of rules followed by speakers of a language: for example, why in English we say &quot;I went out&quot; and not &quot;I out went&quot;. Using correct grammar is a way to communicate effectively, not to feel superior to other people because you know what a conjunction is.\nDon&#39;t feel too downhearted if you were taught grammar badly, or not at all; as the linguist Steven Pinker says: &quot;A preschooler&#39;s tacit knowledge of grammar is more sophisticated  than the thickest style manual&quot;"

They can be historic (&quot;Man walks on Moon&quot;), campaigning (&quot;He lied and lied and lied&quot;), classical (&quot;Between Cilla and Charybdis&quot;), subtle (&quot;Flo quiets the Dons&quot;), funny (&quot;Super Caley go ballistic – Celtic are atrocious&quot;), notorious (&quot;Gotcha!&quot;), scurrilous (&quot;Zip me up before you go-go&quot;), or downright absurd (&quot;Freddie Starr ate my hamster&quot;). There is no magic formula but here are a few guidelines. \nUse active verbs where possible, particularly in news headlines: &quot;Editor updates style guidelines&quot; is much better than &quot;Style guidelines updated&quot;. \nAvoid tabloid cliches such as bid, brand, dub and slam, and their broadsheet counterparts such as insist, signal and target. Imagining that you are describing an event, in words, to real people, is a good antidote to journalese: no one in a pub says &quot;Did you see that Brown slammed Blair in \na dramatic power bid?&quot; \nJust as we would in copy, we need to take care with words such as debacle, farce and fiasco, especially when combined, which we contrived to do in the headline &quot;Hips fiasco descends into farce&quot;– the fact that &quot;Hips farce descends into fiasco&quot; would work just as well tells you something is probably wrong here. \nStrive to be fresh: tired plays on the phrase &quot;Mind the gap&quot;, heard only occasionally these days by passengers on the London underground, have become tedious, as well as either baffling or infuriating to readers who do not happen to live in the capital."

Question marks are also to be avoided, as are quotation marks, unless essential to signify a quote or for legal reasons. And we should resist the temptation to save space by replacing &quot;and&quot; with a comma: &quot;Blair and Brown agree euro deal&quot; not &quot;Blair, Brown agree euro deal&quot;. \nPuns are fine – &quot;Where there&#39;s muck there&#39;s bras&quot;, about a farmer&#39;s wife who started a lingerie business from a barn, was voted headline of the year by our staff – but do not overuse, or resort to tired puns such as &quot;flushed with success&quot;(this story has got a plumber in it).It is possible to try just a little too hard (&quot;To baldly grow where no mane&#39;s grown before&quot;). In the 1970s and 80s the Guardian suffered from a reputation for excruciating puns; today, we want to be known for clever, original and witty headlines. \nUnexpected twists, or subtle plays on words and phrases, show the subeditor&#39;s craft at its best: a power failure in a theatre became, in the Guardian, &quot;Bad lights stop play&quot;. A light touch can work beautifully: &quot;Drop dead, gorgeous&quot;, on a story about office jealousy, added one comma to a well-known film title to create the perfect headline. When Tate Modern exhibited a giant sun, to create its own indoor climate, the beautiful headline written by the Guardian&#39;s Steve Chamberlain – &quot;But is it weather?&quot; (a rare example of a question mark being required) – deserved to be framed and exhibited in a gallery in its own right."

Long after most people had forgotten the 1960s movie Charlie Bubbles, tabloid sports subeditors continued to mystify their readers by using the headline &quot;Charlie bubbles&quot; whenever anyone called Charlie scored a goal. &quot;Book lack in Ongar&quot;, about a shortage of resources in Essex libraries, remains one of the all-time great headlines, but it only works if you get the reference to John Osborne&#39;s 1956 play Look Back in Anger (or at least it did until Oasis helpfully recorded a song called Don&#39;t Look Back in Anger).\nIt&#39;s time for some formulaic headlines to be given a decent burial, or at least a long rest. &quot;The kids are alright&quot;(based on a song by the Who, and subsequently a film) crops up, with minor variations, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis in British newspapers: &quot;The kids are alright online&quot;, &quot;The kids are all right (and left)&quot;,&quot;The kids are all right, left and centre&quot;, and so on."

How many people still understand the reference? &quot;So lucky, lucky, lucky&quot;, a recent headline we used above a photograph of Kylie Minogue, quoted lyrics from a hit she had in nearly 20 years ago.

In news stories particularly we should use an honorific if it sounds jarring or insensitive not to do so – for example, a woman whose son has been killed on active duty in Iraq should be &quot;Mrs Smith&quot; and not &quot;Smith&quot;. We need to use our judgment and be guided by the tone of the piece.\nFollow traditional Guardian style in leading articles (but not other comment pieces and columns on leader pages): use honorifics after first mention, unless writing about an artist, author, journalist, musician, criminal or dead person; use Ms for women on second mention unless they have expressed a preference for Miss or Mrs. \nSo: at first mention David Cameron, Harriet Harman, Sir Richard Branson, Lady Warsi, Prof John Wells, Dr Bill Bailey, the Rev George Herbert; thereafter Mr Cameron, Ms Harman, Sir Richard, Lady Warsi, Prof Wells, Dr Bailey, Mr Herbert, etc.\nUnder-18s should normally be referred to by their first names"

            text: "Our style is to use one word wherever possible. Hyphens tend to clutter up text (particularly when the computer breaks already hyphenated words at the end of lines). This is a widespread trend in the language: &quot;The transition from space to hyphen to close juxtaposition reflects the progressive institutionalisation of the compound,&quot; as Rodney Huddleston puts it, in his inimitable pithy style, in his Introduction to the Grammar of English.\nInventions, ideas and new concepts often begin life as two words, then become hyphenated, before finally becoming accepted as one word. Why wait? &quot;Wire-less&quot; and &quot;down-stairs&quot; were once hyphenated, and some old-fashioned souls still hyphenate e-mail.\nWords such as chatroom, frontbench, gameplan, housebuyer and standup are all one word in our publications, as are thinktank (not a tank that thinks), longlist (not necessarily a long list) and shortlist (which need not be short).\nThere is no need to use hyphens with most compound adjectives, where the meaning is clear and unambiguous without: civil rights movement, financial services sector, work inspection powers, etc. Hyphens should, however, be used to form short compound adjectives, eg two-tonne vessel, three-year deal, 19th-century artist. Also use hyphens where not using one would be ambiguous, eg to distinguish &quot;black-cab drivers come under attack&quot; from &quot;black cab-drivers come under attack&quot;. A missing hyphen in a review of Chekhov&#39;s Three Sisters led us to refer to &quot;the servant abusing Natasha&quot;, rather than &quot;the servant-abusing Natasha&quot;.\nDo not use hyphens after adverbs ending in -ly, eg a hotly disputed penalty, a constantly evolving newspaper, genetically modified food, etc, but hyphens are needed with short and common adverbs, eg ever-forgiving family, much-loved character, well-established principle of style (note, however, that in the construction &quot;the principles of style are well established&quot; there is no need to hyphenate)."

            text: "When an adverb can also be an adjective (eg hard), the hyphen is required to avoid ambiguity – it&#39;s not a hard, pressed person, but a hard-pressed one; an ill-prepared report, rather than an ill, prepared one.\nUse a hyphen in verbs where necessary to stop this kind of thing happening:\nMotorists\ntold: don&#39;t\npanic buy\npetrol\n(While not panicking may well have been advisable, they had actually been told not to panic-buy.)\nPrefixes such as macro, mega, micro, mini, multi, over, super and under rarely need hyphens: examples are listed separately. Follow Collins when a word or phrase is not listed"

As understanding of the two systems is a matter of generations, conversions (in brackets) to imperial units should be provided wherever this seems useful, though usually one conversion – the first – will suffice. Imperial units in quoted matter should be retained, and converted to metric [in square brackets] if it doesn&#39;t ruin the flow of the quote.\n\nIt is not necessary to convert moderate distances between metres and yards, which are close enough for rough and ready purposes (though it is preferable to use metres), or small domestic  quantities: two litres of wine, a kilogramme of sugar, a couple of pounds of apples, a few inches of string. Small units should be converted when precision is required: 44mm (1.7in) of rain fell in two hours. But be sensible: don&#39;t convert a metric estimate into a precise imperial figure (round the conversion up or down). Tons and tonnes are close enough for most purposes to do without conversion; use tonnes (except in shipping tonnage).\n\nBody weights and heights should always be converted in brackets: metres to feet and inches, kilogrammes to stones/pounds. Geographical heights and depths, of people, buildings, monuments, etc, should be converted, metres to feet. In square measurement, land is given in sq metres, hectares and sq km, with sq yards, acres or sq miles in brackets where there is space to provide a conversion. The floor areas of buildings are conventionally expressed in sq metres (or sq ft). Take great care in conversions of square and cubic measures: 2 metres is about 6.5 feet, but 2 sq metres is about 21.5 sq feet"

            text: "Numbers have always contained power, and many a journalist will tremble at the very sight of them. But most often the only maths we need to make sense of them is simple arithmetic. Far more important are our critical faculties, all too often switched off at the first sniff of a figure.\nIt&#39;s easy to be hoodwinked by big numbers in particular. But are they really so big? Compared with what? And what is being assumed? A government announcement of an extra £Xm a year will look far less impressive if divided by 60 million (the British population) and/or 52 (weeks in the year). That&#39;s quite apart from the fact that it was probably trumpeted last week already, as part of another, bigger number.\nNever invent a big figure when a small one will do. Totting jail sentences together (&quot;the six men were jailed for a total of 87 years&quot;) is meaningless as well as irritating. Similarly, saying that something has an area the size of 150 football pitches, or is &quot;eight times the size of Wales&quot;, is cliched and may not be helpful."

Square miles and miles square are constantly confused: an area 10 miles square is 10 miles by 10 miles, which equals 100 square miles. \n\n2 Be extremely wary of (or don&#39;t bother) converting changes in temperature; you run the risk of confusing absolute and relative temperatures, eg while a temperature of 2C is about the same as 36F, a temperature change of 2C corresponds to a change of about 4F.\n\n3 When calculating percentages, beware the &quot;rose by/fell by X%&quot; construction: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase"

Logically, the phrase represents a proportion – just like &quot;17%&quot; or &quot;one-sixth&quot;, both of which take plural verbs. &quot;Two out of every seven&quot; and &quot;three out of 10&quot; take plurals too, functioning identically.\n&quot;One in six is … &quot; is also unnecessarily (and possibly misleadingly) specific, implying that of any six people from the group you take, exactly one will be as described. &quot;One in six&quot; means one-sixth on average over the whole group, and a plural verb better reflects this.

As one of our readers notes: &quot;This usage defines older people by their non-participation in the workforce and immediately typifies them as dependents or drains on the public purse. Rupert Murdoch and Michael Caine are never described as &#39;pensioners&#39; because they are perceived as still contributing to the economy, so does the term only apply to the little people?&quot; Reporters should ask what job people used to do and then describe them as a retired banker/powerboat racer or former whatever (including homemaker)"

            text: "From the editor:\nIf a reader reads something in direct quotation marks in the Guardian he/she is entitled to believe that the reporter can vouch directly for the accuracy of the quote.\nCopying quotes out of other newspapers without any form of attribution is simply bad journalism, never mind legally risky. If, where there are no libel issues, you&#39;re going to repeat quotes, then always say where they came from. It won&#39;t be much help in a legal action, but at least the reader can evaluate the reliability of the source. A quote in the Sunday Sport may – who knows – count for less than one from the Wall Street Journal.\nIf we&#39;re taking quotes from the radio or television it is our general policy to include an attribution. This matters less if it is a pooled interview or news conference that happens to be covered by, say, the BBC or Sky. If the quote comes from an exclusive interview on a radio or TV programme (eg, Today, Channel 4 News or Newsnight) we should always include an attribution.\nSome further guidelines:\n• Take care with direct speech: our readers should be confident that words appearing in quotation marks accurately represent the actual words uttered by the speaker, although ums and ahems can be removed and bad grammar improved. If you aren&#39;t sure of the exact wording, use indirect speech.\nWhere a lot of material has been left out, start off a new quote with: &quot;He added: ... &quot;, or signify this with an ellipsis.\nTake particular care when extracting from printed material, for example a minister&#39;s resignation letter.\n• Avoid &quot;that&quot; quotes, ie The prosecutors maintained that &quot;this was not a trial about freedom of the internet. Instead, a serious issue has been raised about the rights of the individual.&quot; There is no reason to introduce a complete direct quote of this kind with &quot;that&quot;. It should be The prosecutors maintained: &quot;This was not a trial ... &quot; etc."

I have had numerous complaints about his aggressive behaviour,&quot; said Mrs Pratt.\n&quot;The prime minister is completely out of control, and everyone inside No 10 knows it,&quot; added Andrew Rawnsley.\nIt&#39;s extremely annoying to get to the end of the second par and find out it is a different speaker, because it reads as a continuation of the words of Mrs Pratt.\nAs a general rule, and particularly with lengthy quotations, it is better to start with the attribution, so the reader does not have to engage in a series of mental double-takes trying to find out who is supposed to be saying what. It should be:\nMrs Pratt said: &quot;Gordon Brown is a bully and a liar. I have had numerous complaints about his aggressive behaviour.&quot;\nAndrew Rawnsley added: &quot;The prime minister is completely out of control, and everyone inside No 10 knows it.&quot;\n• Avoid quoting words when it is unnecessary to do so, like this: Benítez said he was &quot;angry&quot; that Liverpool were being written out of the title race.\nYes, maybe, quotation marks if he was &quot;incandescent&quot;, or &quot;spitting with rage&quot; – but it is completely unnecessary to use quotation marks for mundane words and unexceptional quotes. They are even finding their way into headlines, which looks awful.\nSimilarly: MPs said they had not seen any evidence that Andy Coulson &quot;knew that phone hacking was taking place&quot;. There is no need for the quotation marks, which are splattered like confetti across the paper and website every day but should be used only when it is necessary, in both copy and headlines"

Letters expressing similar sentiments come from across Britain (and, indeed, from around the world):\nWe don&#39;t carry much coverage of events in Scotland and to be honest, even as an expat, that suits me fine. But I do care very much that we acknowledge that Scotland is a separate nation and in many ways a separate country. It has different laws, education system (primary, higher and further), local government, national government, sport, school terms, weather, property market and selling system, bank holidays, right to roam, banks and money, churches, etc. \nIf we really want to be a national newspaper then we need to consider whether our stories apply only to England (and Wales) or Britain, or Scotland only. When we write about teachers&#39; pay deals, we should point out that we mean teachers in England and Wales; Scottish teachers have separate pay and management structures and union. When we write about it being half-term, we should remember that it&#39;s known as mid-term in Scotland. When we write about bank holiday sunshine/rain, we should remember that in Scotland the weather was probably different and it possibly wasn&#39;t even a bank holiday. When we write about the English cricket team, we should be careful not to refer to it as &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;. When the Scottish Cup final is played, we should perhaps consider devoting more than a few paragraphs at the foot of a page to Rangers winning their 100th major trophy (if it had been Manchester United we&#39;d have had pages and pages with Bobby Charlton&#39;s all-time fantasy first XI and a dissertation on why English clubs are the best in Europe). Andy Murray is Scottish, as well as British, rather than Scottish when he loses and British when he wins.\n\nThese daily oversights come across to a Scot as arrogance. They also undermine confidence in what the paper is telling the reader"

Should it be used more? I think so, yes. A semicolon is a partial pause, a different way of pausing, without using a full stop. I use it all the time&quot; and George Bernard Shaw told TE Lawrence that not using semicolons was &quot;a symptom of mental defectiveness, probably induced by camp life&quot;.\nOrwell, on the other hand, thought they were unnecessary and Kurt Vonnegut advised: &quot;Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites, standing for absolutely nothing. All they do is show you&#39;ve been to college.&quot;"

It seems obvious enough. But inside many journalists – this goes for desk editors as much as reporters – there is a little demon prompting us to make the story as strong and interesting as possible, if not more so. We drop a few excitable adjectives around the place. We overegg. We may even sex it up.\nStrong stories are good. So are interesting stories. But straight, accurate stories are even better. Readers who stick with us over any length of time would far rather judge what we write by our own Richter scale of news judgments and values than feel that we&#39;re measuring ourselves against the competition. Every time we flam a story up we disappoint somebody – usually a reader who thought the Guardian was different.\nWe should be different. Of course we compete fiercely in the most competitive newspaper market in the world. Of course we want to sell as many copies as possible. We&#39;ve all experienced peer pressure to write something as strongly as possible, if not more so. But our Scott Trust ownership relieves us of the necessity to drive remorselessly for circulation to the exclusion of all else. In other words, we don&#39;t need to sex things up, and we shouldn&#39;t"

I would like to read that someone is &#39;homosexual&#39;, not &#39;a homosexual&#39;, or about &#39;gay people&#39;, not &#39;gays&#39;. Lesbian is different as it is a noun which later began to be used adjectivally, not the other way round. As an example from Wednesday, the opening line &#39;Documents which showed that Lord Byron … was a bisexual&#39; rather than &#39;was bisexual&#39; sounds both Daily Mail-esque and stylistically poor.&quot;"

Note also that the female name Consuelo ends with an &quot;o&quot; not an &quot;a&quot;.\nIn Spanish the natural stress of a word generally occurs on the second to last syllable. Words that deviate from this norm must carry a written accent mark, known as the acento ortográfico, to indicate where the stress falls. A guide to accents follows. If in doubt do an internet search (try the word with and without an accent) and look for reputable Spanish language sites, eg big newspapers.\nSurnames ending -ez take an accent over the penultimate vowel, eg Benítez, Fernández, Giménez, Gómez, González, Gutiérrez, Hernández, Jiménez, López, Márquez, Martínez, Núñez, Ordóñez, Pérez, Quiñónez, Ramírez, Rodríguez, Sáez, Vásquez, Vázquez, Velázquez. Exception: Alvarez; note also that names ending -es do not take the accent, eg Martines, Rodrigues.\nOther surnames Aristízabal, Beltrán, Cáceres, Calderón, Cañizares, Chevantón, Couñago, Cúper, Dalí, De la Peña, Díaz, Forlán, García, Gaudí, Miró, Muñoz, Olazábal, Pavón, Sáenz, Sáinz, Valdés, Valerón, Verón."

Those who neither know nor care are the vast majority, and are happy folk, to be envied.&quot; (HW Fowler, Modern English Usage, 1926)\nIt is perfectly acceptable, and often desirable, to sensibly split infinitives – &quot;to boldly go&quot; is an elegant and effective phrase – and stubbornly to resist doing so can sound pompous and awkward (&quot;the economic precipice on which they claim perpetually to be poised&quot;) or ambiguous: &quot;He even offered personally to guarantee the loan that the Clintons needed to buy their house&quot; raises the question of whether the offer, or the guarantee, was personal. \nRaymond Chandler wrote to his publisher: &quot;Would you convey my compliments to the purist who reads your proofs and tell him or her that I write in a sort of broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will stay split.&quot; And after an editor tinkered with his infinitives, George Bernard Shaw said: &quot;I don&#39;t care if he is made to go quickly, or to quickly go – but go he must!&quot;"

Two examples from the same issue in April 2010 in which &quot;was&quot; should be &quot;were&quot;:\n&quot;If every election or ballot in which there are cases of bad practice was to be invalidated, democracy would soon become a laughing stock ...&quot; (leading article); &quot;If this was the centred Conservative party that Cameron claims, its strategists wouldn&#39;t be half as worried as they are ...&quot; (column)\nNobody died and no great harm was done, but as professional writers we should be aware of the distinction. Used properly, the subjunctive can add elegance to your writing; an object lesson was provided in a Gary Younge column of 5 July 2010: &quot;It was as though Charlie Brown&#39;s teacher were standing for leader of the opposition ... &quot; (one of three examples of the subjunctive in the piece).\nAs with the hyper-corrective misuse of whom instead of who, however, using the subjunctive wrongly is worse than not using it at all, and will make you look pompous and silly"

            text: "We are more liberal than any other newspapers, using language that most of our competitors would not. The statistics tell their own story: the word &quot;fuck&quot; (and its variants) appeared 705 times in the Guardian in the 12 months to April 2010, with a further 269 mentions in the Observer. (The figures for other national newspapers were as follows: Independent 279, Independent on Sunday 74, Times 3, Sunday Times 2, all other papers 0.) The figures for the C-word, still regarded by many people as taboo, were: Guardian 49, Observer 20, Independent 8, Independent on Sunday 5, everyone else 0.\n\nEven some readers who agree with Lenny Bruce that &quot;take away the right to say fuck and you take away the right to say fuck the government&quot; might feel that we sometimes use such words unnecessarily, although comments in response to Guardian Style&#39;s blogpost on the subject were overwhelmingly in support of our policy.\nThe editor&#39;s guidelines are as follows:\nFirst, remember the reader, and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend.\nSecond, use such words only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article; there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes.\nThird, the stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it.\nFinally, never use asterisks, or such silliness as b------, which are just a cop-out, as Charlotte Brontë recognised: &quot;The practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent people are wont to garnish their discourse, strikes me as a proceeding which, however well meant, is weak and futile. I cannot tell what good it does – what feeling it spares – what horror it conceals&quot;"

It is designed to create a state of terror in the minds of a particular group of people or the public as a whole for political or social ends. Although most terrorist acts are violent, you can be a terrorist without being overtly violent (eg poisoning a water supply or gassing people on the underground).\n\nDoes having a good cause make a difference? The UN says no: &quot;Criminal acts calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public are in any circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them.&quot;\n\nWhatever one&#39;s political sympathies, suicide bombers, the 9/11 attackers and most paramilitary groups can all reasonably be regarded as terrorists (or at least groups some of whose members perpetrate terrorist acts).\n\nNonetheless we need to be very careful about using the term: it is still a subjective judgment – one person&#39;s terrorist may be another person&#39;s freedom fighter, and there are former &quot;terrorists&quot; holding elected office in many parts of the world. Some critics suggest that, for the Guardian, all terrorists are militants – unless their victims are British. Others may point to what they regard as &quot;state terrorism&quot;."

The most important thing is that, in news reporting, we are not seen – because of the language we use – to be taking sides.\n\nNote that the phrase &quot;war on terror&quot; should always appear in quotes, whether used by us or (more likely) quoting someone else"

If you are not sure, it is much better to use &quot;who&quot; when &quot;whom&quot; would traditionally have been required than to use &quot;whom&quot; incorrectly for &quot;who&quot;, something even great writers have been guilty of: &quot;There was a big man whom I think was an hôtelier from Phnom Penh and a French girl I&#39;d never seen before ...&quot; (The Quiet American, Graham Greene – who as a former subeditor should have known better)."

So in most cases, where there is dispute over whether a noun takes a -y or an -ie ending, the correct answer is -ie: she&#39;s a girly girl, but she&#39;s no helpless girlie. Think also scrunchie, beanie, nightie, meanie ... There are exceptions (a hippy, an indie band), but where specific examples are not given, use -ie for nouns and -y for adjectives'

            text: "Give some thought to where you place the time element in a story: do not automatically put it at the start (&quot;David Cameron yesterday insisted ... &quot;), a style satirised by the subeditor turned bestselling author Bill Bryson, who wrote: &quot;Anyone not acquainted with journalists could be forgiven for assuming that they must talk something like this: I last night went to bed early because I this morning had to catch an early flight.&quot;\nConstructions such as &quot;the two sides were today to consider&quot;, as we have been known to say, sound ugly and artificial. As with headlines, try reading out loud to find the most natural arrangement.\nRemember that we have millions of readers in different time zones around the world, for whom yesterday, today and tomorrow will not necessarily mean the same thing. Terms such as yesterday, today, tonight and tomorrow should not be used on the website: if you need to specify, say &quot;on Wednesday&quot;, etc.\n&quot;Yesterday&quot; remains appropriate for some newspaper stories, which are most likely to be read in the UK first thing in the morning, but not for the website, which may be read at any time, anywhere in the world"
